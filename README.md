# End-To-End Ecommerce Data Engineering Project

This project showcases the development of a comprehensive data engineering pipeline for an eCommerce platform. The pipeline is designed to handle data ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL), utilizing various AWS services and Python libraries.


### Technologies used:  
AWS S3, Athena, Glue, Redshift, pandas, Jupyter Notebooks.
### Project Workflow:

- Data Storage: Raw eCommerce data is stored in Amazon S3.
- Metadata Extraction: AWS Glue Crawler retrieves metadata from S3.
- Data Loading: Data is queried from S3 into Jupyter Notebooks using Amazon Athena.
- Data Transformation: Data is cleaned and transformed with pandas.
- Output Storage: Transformed data is saved back to S3.
- Data Warehousing: AWS Glue loads data from S3 into Amazon Redshift.
- Visualization: Insights into customer behavior and product performance are visualized.
